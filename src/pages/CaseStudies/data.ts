        "Profitability Blind Spots: No clear view of which categories, products, or regions drove profits versus those eroding margins.",
        "Sales Trends & Seasonality: Lack of reliable trend analysis to detect seasonality shifts, demand peaks, or declining categories.",
        "Product Lifecycle Monitoring: Underperforming or declining products stayed too long in the catalog; high-margin products werenâ€™t always prioritized.",
        "Comparative Analysis Gaps: Difficulty comparing YoY performance across departments, regions, or product lines.",
        "Data Fragmentation & Manual Reporting: Sales and inventory data scattered across Excel, CSVs, and databases; manual, inconsistent, and outdated reports delayed decisions and lacked a single source of truth.",
